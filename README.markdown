# CLA and CAA list

All sorts of CLA and CAA are out there used in the wild for different FOSS projects.

There are also clearly concerns about whether or not to use one, but similarly as with (FOSS) licenses, not all CLA/CAA were created equal. And to even start having a meaningful discussion, we need to agree on what is the name and content of the discussed material.

This is the goal of this repository – to log, name (and categorise) all the CLA an CAA we see in FOSS projects.

## Short-term plans

- [ ] gather as many CLA and CAA texts out there as I can – please, if you know some, create a pull/merge request to the `usorted/` folder

## Mid-term plans

- [ ] clean up the texts to be plaintext (or MarkDown, _to be discussed_)
- [ ] provide unique long and short names for each of them
- [ ] organize them into categories

Current ideas of categories – _to be discussed_:

- CAA – copyright _assignment_
- CLA – copyright _license_ (perhaps further divide between exclusive and non-exclusive)

- balanced – the contributor retains their rights
- unbalanced – the contributor loses their rights


## Long-term plans and ideas

It would be great if in the future this list would be as organised as the [SPDX License List][spdx_licenses] and apply (something similar to) its [XML templates][spdx_templates] to match and identify CLA/CAA texts out in the wild. _To be discussed._
